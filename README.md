# DistanceMeasurement

## Description
This project measures distances using sensors and provides a visual representation of the results through a display and LEDs. The system is designed to be intuitive and efficient, making it ideal for applications in automation, robotics, and safety systems. The project utilizes an ultrasonic distance sensor to capture measurements, which are then processed and displayed in real time. The LEDs serve as indicators for specific predefined ranges, providing immediate feedback on the measured distance.

The system is configured so that:
- **LED 1** lights up when the measured distance is **less than 1 meter**.
- **LED 2** lights up when the measured distance is **1 meter or more**.

Additionally, this system is designed to be easily replicable and customizable, catering to a wide range of use cases. By integrating affordable and accessible components like the Raspberry Pi and HC-SR04 sensor, the project demonstrates how advanced functionality can be achieved with minimal resources. This makes it suitable for educational purposes as well as practical implementations in various industries.

Future enhancements could include:
- Adding wireless communication for remote monitoring.
- Expanding the system with additional sensors for more complex measurements.
- Integrating a web interface to visualize data.

Detailed documentation ensures that users can set up and adapt the system with ease, even if they have limited technical experience.

## Features

## Setup

### System Update and Preparation
1. Update and upgrade the Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. Install dependencies for Python 3.10:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev curl libbz2-dev
   ```

3. Download and install Python 3.10:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/Python-3.10.9.tgz
   tar -xf Python-3.10.9.tgz
   cd Python-3.10.9
   ./configure --enable-optimizations
   make -j $(nproc)
   sudo make altinstall
   ```

### Virtual Environment Setup
1. Install the virtual environment package:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y python3.10-venv
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv myprojectenv
   source myprojectenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install RPi.GPIO Pillow adafruit-circuitpython-st7735r
   ```

### Hardware Configuration
1. Connect the **ultrasonic sensor** to the Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO pins.
2. Wire the LEDs to GPIO pins with appropriate resistors for current limiting.
3. Connect the **TFT display** to the Raspberry Pi using SPI or I2C.
4. Enable SPI on the Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
