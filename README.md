# DistanceMeasurement

## Description
This project measures distances using sensors and provides a visual representation of the results through a display and LEDs. The system is designed to be intuitive and efficient, making it ideal for applications in automation, robotics, and safety systems. The project utilizes an ultrasonic distance sensor to capture measurements, which are then processed and displayed in real time. The LEDs serve as indicators for specific predefined ranges, providing immediate feedback on the measured distance. Additionally, this system is designed to be easily replicable and customizable, catering to a wide range of use cases.

By integrating affordable and accessible components like the Raspberry Pi and HC-SR04 sensor, the project demonstrates how advanced functionality can be achieved with minimal resources. This makes it suitable for educational purposes as well as practical implementations in various industries. Detailed documentation ensures that users can set up and adapt the system with ease, even if they have limited technical experience. Future enhancements could include adding wireless communication or integrating additional sensors to expand the system's capabilities.
