# DistanceMeasurement
 This project is a distance measurement system that uses sensors to accurately measure distances and display the results on a screen. Additionally, LEDs indicate whether the measured distances fall within specific predefined ranges, providing a clear and immediate visual feedback. This system is suitable for applications in automation, robotics, and safety monitoring.
